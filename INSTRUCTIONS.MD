# Helpful Human Applicant Interview Challenge

Welcome to Helpful Human's at home proficiency challenge! This challenge gauges your knowledge on a few different metrics that we use, in part, to evaluate your skills. In this repo, you will find the assets that are required to replicate the design that is also included in this repo. Both .sketch and .png assets are available.

To get started, clone this repo. Add your work to it in whatever structure you prefer, then push it to your own, renamed repo. When you are finished, follow the instructions at the end of this document.

This challenge has different milestones.

## Core
Stated briefly, the core goal is to create a simple but functional app that has a data, view and logic layer. The app will display color swatches, and that's about it!

The core goals should be completed in full. 

## Stretch
The stretch goals can also be met if you choose to do so. Not completing the stretch goals does not disqualify you in any way nor will it lead to a disadvantage in comparison to other applicants.

## Bonus Stretch
Bonus stretch goals inherit properties of stretch goals but completing these goals will say to us, "I believe the code I've written for the core goals and the stretch goals is production ready".

## Additional Information
An applicant completing a well thought out solution to the core challenges is just as meaningful to us as a solution that completes all goals but is not implemented very well.

If you'd like to implement additional functionality, or change the functionality of this challenge, feel free but be prepared to discuss your reasoning for doing so. We like critical thinking. We don't like improper implementation without reason.

## Time
Keep track of how much time you spent on the challenge but also feel free to spend as much time as you want. Your time is very valuable and we are thankful you're taking the time demonstrate your skills for us.
